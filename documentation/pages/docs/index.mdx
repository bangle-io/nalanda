# Nalanda State Management

<Callout type="info">
Nalanda is in early release. We're striving to make it production-ready.
</Callout>

## Why?

Nalanda State Management (NSM) was created to provide a scalable state management solution independent of React or other UI libraries. While developing [Bangle.io](https://bangle.io), I found that many existing solutions, though effective for simple apps, struggled as app complexity grew due to their UI framework dependencies.

Current state management tools often face challenges such as:
- **UI Framework Dependency**: Tying state management to a specific UI framework.
- **Deriving State**: Limited support for deriving state efficiently.
- **Handling Side Effects**: Insufficient methods like `React.useEffect` that are too DOM-centric.
- **State Dependencies**: Ignoring the need to manage state interdependencies.
- **Encapsulation**: Difficulty in keeping parts of the state internal.
- **Legacy Issues**: Outdated API structures.
- **Typescript Support**: Inadequate first-party Typescript support.
- **Intuitive**: Some modern libraries compromise intuitiveness for brevity.

While some libraries address a few of these concerns, NSM offers a comprehensive solution, aiming to tackle all these challenges.

## How?

Drawing from atomic state management systems like Angular signals, Solid signals, Jotai, and Redux, NSM integrates their best aspects while ensuring an intuitive API.

**Example: Fetching and Storing Data**

With NSM, fetching data and updating state is straightforward:

```ts filename="fetch-user-slice.ts"
import { cleanup, createKey } from '@nalanda/core';

// key helps us build rest of the pieces in a type safe manner
const key = createKey('login-user', []);

// initialize a state field
const isLoggedInField = key.field(false);

// effect is a function that runs when the state changes
key.effect((store) => {
  // .track ensures effect is only run when `isLoggedIn` changes
  const isLoggedIn = isLoggedInField.track(store);

  if (!isLoggedIn) {
    const abort = new AbortController();
    // cleanup is called before the effect is run again
    cleanup(store, () => {
      abort.abort();
    });

    await fetch('https://login-user.com', { signal: abort.signal });
  
    store.dispatch(
      // update the state
      isLoggedInField.update(true)
    );
  }
});
```

1. Encapsulating Effects: Forget the lengthy useEffect hooks. With NSM, effects are high-level, freeing you from tying them to specific UI components. 
Your UI components remain oblivious to any background effects, enhancing encapsulation and separation of concerns.

1. Auto tracking: NSM eliminates the hassle of handling hook dependencies. You'll appreciate the balanced mix of magic and explicitness. 
Only values you track by doing `const { x } = slice.track()` get tracked. 
The next run of effect will be triggered only when these one of the tracked values change.

1. Cleanups: Introduce a cleanup call immediately after declaring a resource. This will help reduce the `useEffect` callback hell.
