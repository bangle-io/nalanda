# Effect Store

Effect store is only found as the first argument to an [`effect`](/docs/api/key/#effect) callback.


## `.state`

Effect store is similar to the regular [Store](/docs/api/store) and you can access the current [StoreState](/docs/api/store-state) just like you can do in regular store by doing `store.state`.

Signature:

```ts
store.state: StoreState;
```

Example:

```ts
key.effect(store => {
    store.state // StoreState
})
```


## `.dispatch()`

Effect store has a `dispatch` method that can be used to dispatch actions to the store.

Signature:

```ts
store.dispatch(transaction: Transaction): void;
```

Arguments:

- `transaction` - A [Transaction](/docs/api/transaction) object that describes the action to be dispatched.

Example:

```ts
key.effect(store => {
  store.dispatch(slice.someAction());
})
```
