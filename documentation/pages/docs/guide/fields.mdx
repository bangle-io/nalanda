# Fields

In this guide, we'll craft a basic counter slice and dive into understanding Fields.

## Concepts

### Key

A key serves as a builder for a slice. It organizes the components of the slice and defines its dependencies.

```ts filename="counter-slice.ts"
import { createKey } from '@nalanda/core';

// Set up a key for the 'counter-slice'
const key = createKey('counter-slice', []);
```

[See Key API Documentation](/docs/api/key).


### State Fields 

State Fields are simple wrappers around storing values. They are the building blocks of a slice.

```ts filename="counter-slice.ts"

// Initialize a Field with a default value of 0
const counterField = key.field(0);

counterField.get(store.state) // 0
```

[See StateField API Documentation](/docs/api/state-field).

<Callout type="warning">
Always keep Fields private to their respective files; <bold>don't export them.</bold>
To share data linked with a field, refer to [Slices](#slices).
</Callout>

### Derived Fields

Derived Fields are dynamic constructs that calculate their values from other fields or slices. 
They optimize performance by calculating values as needed (lazy) and then storing them (caching), preventing unnecessary recalculations.

```ts filename="counter-slice.ts"
// Initialize a derived field that depends on counterField
const doubleCounterField = key.derive((state) => {
  return counterField.get(state) * 2;
});
```

Derived fields are pretty versatile - they can compute values from other derived fields, state fields, or slices.

```ts filename="counter-slice.ts"
// Initialize a derived field that depends on multiple fields
const omegaCounterField = key.derive((state) => {
  return doubleCounterField.get(state) * 3 + counterField.get(state);
});
```

[See DerivedField API Documentation](/docs/api/derived-field).

#### Note on Purity ⚠️

Ensure derived fields are pure:

- <bold>Avoid mutating the state</bold> or any other fields.
- Do not invoke side-effects, such as API calls or logging.
- Do not call any impure functions like `Math.random()` or `Date.now()`.

## Data Handling

### Reading Data

You'll require either [Store](/docs/guide/store) or [StoreState](/docs/guide/store) to read data from a Field.

Nalanda offers access to StoreState, as seen in the [.derive()](/docs/api/key) method when creating a DerivedField:

```ts filename="counter-slice.ts"
// derive provides StoreState as the first argument to the callback
const doubleCounterField = key.derive((state) => {
  return counterField.get(state) * 2;
});
```

While [`.effect()`](/docs/guide/effects/) exposes Store as the first argument.
With store you can get the current state by accessing `store.state`:

```ts filename="counter-slice.ts"
key.effect(store => {
  // Get the current state
  counterField.get(store.state) // 0
  doubleCounterField.get(store.state) // 0
})
```

### Updating Data

In Nalanda we use [Transactions](/docs/guide/actions) to update the store state.
We recommend creating helper functions called Actions that return transactions for updating the store state.

```ts filename="counter-slice.ts"
// incrementAction returns a transaction for incrementing the counterField by 1
function incrementAction() {
  const transaction = counterField.update((value) => value + 1);
  return transaction;
}
```

Now that we have an action, we can dispatch it to the store to update the store state.

```ts filename="counter-slice.ts"
store.dispatch(incrementAction());

// after dispatch store state is updated 
counterField.get(store.state) // 1
doubleCounterField.get(store.state) // 2
```

<Callout type="info">

An important thing to remember is that the store state (or simply `state`) is immutable and can never change. Whenever there is a new state, `store.state` will point to the new state.
