# Common errors

## Store Context

#### `Cannot create a context store with a slice that is already associated with another store`

This error occurs if you have multiple stores in your app and you are using the `createContextStore` method that uses React Context to share NSM store behind the scenes.

- Solution1: If you want to use _multiple stores_ then you will have to use the [createStore](/docs/api/store/#createstore) function to create store and share it on by your self to all components that need it.
- Solution2: Use a single store for your entire app.
