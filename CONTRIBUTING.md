```sh
git clone git@github.com:bangle-io/nalanda.git
cd nalanda
```

## Project Structure

Nalanda project is broken into the following directory structure:

- **packages**: contains the Nalanda library packages. If you are **not** sure, more than likely, you'll be making changes here.
- **documentation**: contains the documentation website built with Next.js and MDX.
- **config**: Holds shared configurations for the entire project, including files like tsconfig.json, .eslintrc, and .prettierrc.

## üîç Testing Your Changes

Before submitting a PR, make sure to test your changes locally. Here's how:

- Ensure your changes don't break anything. Run the tests with:

  ```sh
  pnpm run test
  ```

- Check for lint errors with:

  ```sh
  pnpm run lint
  ```

- Add tests for new features or changes. We love tests! ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Submitting PR

1. Make sure you PR titles are prefixed with one of the following:

   - `breaking-change`: for breaking changes
   - `feat`: for new features
   - `docs`: for documentation changes
   - `fix`: for bug fixes
   - `refactor`: for code refactoring
   - `test`: for adding tests
   - `perf`: for performance improvements
   - `ci`: for CI/CD related changes
   - `build`: for build related changes

> The above convention helps us produce a changelog automatically.

1. Make sure your PRs are rebased on top of the `dev` branch.

1. When merging a PR to `dev`, make sure to squash all commits into one.

## Releasing a new version

1. ensure you are in `dev` branch and upto date with dev (`git pull origin dev`).

1. Run `pnpm -r --filter misc set-version x.y.z` to bump the version.

1. Go to github and create a new release with the tag that was created in the previous step.

1. Run `pnpm publish-alpha --otp=123456` or `publish-latest` to publish the packages to npm.

## Updating documentation site

1. After doing a release, you need to update the documentation site.

1. If you did an alpha release, you don't need to do anything else as the documentation site will automatically update.

1. If you did a latest release, you need to update the documentation site manually.

1. Ensure you are in `dev` branch and upto date with dev (`git pull origin dev`).

1. Make sure the documentation site builds locally with `pnpm run build-docs`.

1. Push changes to `main` branch.

1. This will trigger a build on netlify and the documentation site will be updated at https://nalanda.bangle.io .
